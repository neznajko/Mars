## Mars

\[Yee\], I think this is my first proper Dijkstra Algorithm, although
I'm not sure this is the intended solution, there might be some moar
simple one. I've might ask Musk to add me in the waiting list for
Mars, cos on this planet things are really getting stupid. Em we have
a map of a terrain represented as a 2D array, with each square being
either CLEAR ground, ROUGH terrain, or a ROCK sample. The upper left
corner is the ***start*** and the lower right is the **finish**. A bunch
of robots going from point (0,0) to point (-1,-1) gather rock samples,
and we have to program those units to gather as much samples as possible
